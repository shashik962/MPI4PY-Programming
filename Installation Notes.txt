This document has all the required steps to setup a Raspberry Pi node for Supercomputing with MPICH2 and MPI4PY.

If you are using a VGA Monitor then change the following lines in the /boot/config.txt

Change #disable_overscan=1 	to 	disable_overscan=1
Change #hdmi_force_hotplug=1 	to 	hdmi_force_hotplug=1
Change #hdmi_group=1 		to 	hdmi_group=2
Change #hdmi_mode=1 		to 	hdmi_mode=16
Change #hdmi_drive=2 		to 	hdmi_drive=2
Change #config_hdmi_boost=4 	to 	config_hdmi_boost=4

Step 1: Install Fortran

sudo apt-get install gfortran -y

Step 2: Install MPICH

Navigate to the home directory of pi with following command,
cd ~

Create a directory mpich,
mkdir mpich

Go to the diretory mpich,
cd mpich

Download the latest source of MPICH with wget command,
wget http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.2/mpich-3.2.tar.gz

Now we have to compile and install from this source.
Unpack the file with the following command,
tar xfz mpich-3.2.tar.gz

The command above extracts all the contents in the current directory under a subdirectory mpich-3.2.
Run ls command to check if mpich-3.2 is created in current path.

Go to the tmp directory now.
cd /tmp

Create a directory named as pi in this directory,
mkdir pi

Go to the directory pi with the following command,
cd pi

Create a directory mpi-build here,
mkdir mpi-build

Go to the directory mpi-build with the following command,
cd mpi-build

Run pwd command to verify the path. It should be as follows,
/tmp/pi/mpi-build

mpi-build is the build directory. We will use it for configuring the environment. We will complete the rest of process of installation from within the mpi-build directory.

Create an installation directory for MPICH with the following command,
sudo mkdir /home/pi/mpich-install


sudo /home/pi/mpich/mpich-3.2/configure -prefix=/home/pi/mpich-install 2>&1 | tee c.txt

sudo make VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | tee m.txt

sudo make install 2>&1 | tee mi.txt

After successful installation, we need to add the location /home/pi/mpich-install/bin to PATH variable. 

/home/pi/mpich-install/bin has all the needed binary executable files of MPICH.

Navigate to the home directory,
cd ~

Edit .bashrc file with the following command,
nano .bashrc

Add the following line in the end,
PATH=$PATH:/home/pi/mpich-install/bin

Save the file and exit. Close the lxterminal too.

Next time we open the lxterminal, we will have the path /home/pi/mpich-install/bin in the PATH variable.

Step 3: Install MPI4PY

Navigate to the home directory,
cd ~

Download the latest source of MPI4PY by running the following command,
wget https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py/downloads/mpi4py-2.0.0.tar.gz

Extract the source code by running the following command,
tar zxf mpi4py-2.0.0.tar.gz

The command above will extract the source code in the directory mpi4py-2.0.0. Navigate to the directory,
cd mpi4py-2.0.0

Run the following command to update the OS,
sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
